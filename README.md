What is Kubernetes?
Ans: Kubernetes lets you create, deploy, manage, and scale application containers across one or more host clusters. <br />
A Kubernetes cluster is composed of two separate planes:<br />

<b>Kubernetes control plane</b>:—manages Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them. Include components like the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.<br />
<b>Kubernetes data plane</b>:—machines that can run containerized workloads. Each node is managed by the kubelet, an agent that receives commands from the control plane.
